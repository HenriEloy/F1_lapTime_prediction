Hey, 

I am going to try to make a lap prediction algorithm in less than a day !

I firstly had the bad idea of adressing that problem as a regression issue. But seeing the results, I am now definitly sure it's a timeSeries issue ;) !
With more data and more time, I'm sure there are plenty of room for improvment.

I hope that you find it interesting !
