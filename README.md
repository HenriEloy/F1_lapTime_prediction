Hey,

I'm going to try to create a lap prediction algorithm in less than a day!

I initially had the bad idea of approaching this problem as a regression problem. But seeing the results, I am now sure that it is a time series problem ;)! With more data and more time, I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement.

I hope you find this interesting!
