Welcome to my lap prediction algorithm for Formula 1! In less than a day, I attempted to create a predictive model for F1 lap times.

Initially, I approached this problem as a regression problem. However, after seeing the results, I realized that it is actually a time series problem. With more data and more time, there is a lot of potential for improvement in the future.

I hope you find my project interesting! Here are the results of my prediction of the Ocon Abu Dhabi 2022 last 10 laps:

Thank you for checking out my project!
